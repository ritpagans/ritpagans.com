# It's like build-a-bear

Everyone follows their own path. You might choose to follow an established tradition, or you might choose to create something that is uniquely yours.

We are *all* beginners, and we know it's not easy to just stroll in. Don't worry - we are a remarkably welcoming group. Come say hi!

# Spring of 2021

Welcome to the spring semester of 2021. The skies are gray, and zoom is still our primary method of meeting. Nevertheless, the Pagan club continues! We have meetings, rituals, and new this semester - *seminars* planned.

**Meetings** are held on most weeks. There will be a topic and/or activity.

**Rituals** are held according to the [wheel of the year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_the_Year), and also some full (or new!) moons.

**Seminars** are deep learning dives into a specific topic. They can take the place of normal meetings, or sometimes stand alone.

Newcomers are always welcome at our events (though we encourage reaching out before attending a ritual).

# Schedule

The schedule is currently simmering. Updates will appear here soon!
