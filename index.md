# It's like build-a-bear

Everyone follows their own path. You might choose to follow an established tradition, or you might choose to create something that is uniquely yours.

We are *all* beginners, and we know it's not easy to just stroll in. Don't worry - we are a remarkably welcoming group. Come say hi!

# Fall of 2021

Welcome to the fall semester of 2021. We started the semester strong, we have a *ton* of new members, and we're gonna keep that energy going! We have two types of meetings:

**Meetings** are at 2PM on Sundays. There will be a topic and/or activity. The first meeting of each month is in-person, all others are virtual.

**Rituals** are held according to the [wheel of the year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_of_the_Year), and also some full (or new!) moons.
