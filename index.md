# It's like build-a-bear

Everyone follows their own path. You might choose to follow an established tradition, or you might choose to create something that is uniquely yours.

We are *all* beginners, and we know it's not easy to just stroll in. We  try to be as beginner friendly and welcoming as we can. Come say hi!
